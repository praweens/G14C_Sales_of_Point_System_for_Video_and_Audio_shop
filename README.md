##How to run the system

######So at first, we need to combine all the project files in a single folder. Then, we need to copy and paste that file in htdocs folder which is located in Xampp folder. Next, we have to open any one of the internet browsers such as google chrome then we need to type “localhost” in the address bar.**Then, we go to hpmyadmin to create a new dtabase,named "Jomboo". then import Jomboo.sql into phpmyadmin. Next, we go to priviledges and create a new user with username: "newuser" and pasword: "password"  to grant acces to the database. We need to choose or click our project folder from that page.To begin the system, we need to register our self as a user by using name, email, and password. After that, we can login to the system by using the password that we created. Once we login successfully to the system, we can view the home page of the system. At the home page, first we can see few menubar at the top of the page. Then, we can view the upcoming movies and music album posters below the menu bar.**



**Music**
-  If let’s say we wanted to purchase a song means first we need to click the “Music” on the menu bar. Then, we can access all the list of the songs. After that, we can buy the song that we wanted by clicking the “Buy Now!” button on the right-hand side. Then, a confirmation box will appear for the user’s confirmation. Then, we can choose the next song that we wanted to purchase by using the same method by clicking the “Buy Now!” button. To view the list of songs that we purchase, we need to click “My music” at the menu bar then we view all the music that we purchased recently.

**Movie**
-  If let’s say we wanted to purchase or rent a movie means first we need to click the “Movie” on the menu bar. Then, we can access all the list of the movie. After that, we can buy the movie that we wanted by clicking the “Buy Now!” or can rent the movie by clicking the “Rent Now” button on the right-hand side. If we click the “Buy Now!” or “Rent Now!” button, a confirmation box will appear for the user’s confirmation. Then, after confirming it by click “Ok” button at the alert box then we able choose the next movie that we wanted to purchase by using the same method by clicking the “Buy Now!” or “Rent Now!” button. To view the list of movie that we purchase and rent, we need to click “My movie” at the menu bar then we view all the music that we purchase and rent recently.
Users also able to see their account information such as name, username, email and registered date at “My Account”.

##Conclusion
###### After a few weeks of hard work and discussion on preparing the assignment, finally, we managed to complete all those documentation and programs on time. Our program worked perfectly after going through a number of discussions, arrangements, and adjustments. Although there are only four of us in a group but we still cooperate in completing the given assignment.######
######We are given enough time to complete our assignment and overall results are satisfactory. The assignment is completed but there are still many improvements in order to make a perfect and efficient program. Other than that, we also faced many problems while coding the program, but with the help and guide of our lecturer, we managed to overcome those errors. We would like to thank our lecturer for assisting us throughout this project.In the report, all aspects are given clear descriptions and guiding principles. We hope that our program possibly will help all the users or students to make their work trouble-free. If there are any problems with our program, we will try our very best to improve and get better of it.######
